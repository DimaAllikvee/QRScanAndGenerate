### Description

This Python project is a comprehensive QR Code application that allows users to generate and scan QR codes. Built using various libraries such as `cv2` for computer vision, `qreader` for QR code reading, `customtkinter` for the GUI, `PIL` for image processing, and `qrcode` for QR code generation, it offers a user-friendly interface with multiple functionalities.

**Key Features:**
1. **Generate QR Codes from URL and Text:**
   - Users can enter a URL or text to generate a QR code.
   - The generated QR code is displayed in the application.
   - Users can customize the color of the QR code before generating it.
  
2. **Scan QR Codes:**
   - Users can scan QR codes using their webcam.
   - The scanned QR code content is detected and displayed in the console.

3. **GUI Interface:**
   - Built using `customtkinter`, the application provides a modern and intuitive interface.
   - The main window includes navigation buttons to switch between different functionalities (Home, Generate QR Code from URL, Generate QR Code from Text, Change Color, and About).
   - Includes a "About" section displaying developer information.

  To ensure that the provided code runs smoothly, you'll need to install the necessary Python packages using pip. Here's a list of packages required by the code:

1. **OpenCV (`cv2`)**: Used for computer vision tasks, including webcam access and image manipulation.
   ```
   pip install opencv-python
   ```
